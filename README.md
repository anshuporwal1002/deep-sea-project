Why Are Deep-Sea Creatures Coming to the Surface?
Causes:

Climate Change & Rising Ocean Temperatures
Warmer waters disrupt natural habitats, forcing species to move to the surface.

Ocean Acidification
CO₂ absorption lowers pH, affecting deep-sea organisms' shells, metabolism, and behavior.

Underwater Earthquakes or Volcanic Activity
Seismic disturbances drive deep-sea species away from their habitats.

Pollution and Oxygen Depletion
Hypoxic zones and toxic environments push marine life toward oxygen-rich layers.

Deep-Sea Mining and Trawling
Human activity disturbs ecosystems, causing displacement.

✅ Solutions:
Early Detection & Monitoring
Use AI, sensors, and real-time data to detect and visualize sightings.

Combat Climate Change
Reduce emissions and promote renewable energy sources.

Ocean Cleanup Initiatives
Reduce plastic waste and participate in conservation efforts.

Protect Marine Ecosystems
Establish marine protected areas and enforce environmental laws.

Public Awareness & Education
Educate communities using digital platforms, visuals, and alerts.
